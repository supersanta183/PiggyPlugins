# Instructions
Simply drag and drop `piggy-loader` into your `sideloaded-plugins` folder.

If you already have EthanApiPlugin on your runelite already, open loader config & disable the option to download EthanApi.

If you don't have a `sideloaded-plugins` folder, you'll want to grab `ethan-api-standalone` from the releases and follow the more detailed instructions in our discord.
